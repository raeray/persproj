The only good thing there was the crab legs because they're suppose to be cold and the tacos because it was freshly made. The food was under a single lamp that didn't heat the food at all. We let the server know that the food was cold and he told the manager that was in charge. All she did was come over to ask what the problem was and said she was going to talk to the chief. Have no idea what actually happened though because we didn't see her after that. Half the buffet was closed as well so there wasn't that many options. I must say i rather go to the Rio buffet.

       "array(['Came here for the XX time since Bellagio opened recently on Sunday for dinner. I used to come a decent amount when Bellagio first opened but I haven\\'t been here for at least 5-10 years. When Bellagio first opened, i remember how strict they were with not allowing anyone under the age of 21 to enter the hotel. But also, at that same time, Bellagio\\'s buffet was the top buffet in the city offering huge king crab legs, kobe beef, and some other things. I was way too young at that point to really appreciate the quality/quantity but i do remember how it used to be. \\n\\nWe had heard that the buffet had made some changes and improved (from a frequent customer), as well as bring a few popular dishes from a few restaurants to be available at the buffet as well. \\n\\n- Lago by Julian Serrano\\'s Malloreddus Pasta with pork sausage and tomato sauce\\n- Harvest by Roy Ellamar\\'s chopped spinach salad with Blue Lizard Farm\\'s bloomsdale spinach, bacon, blue cheese, asparagus and tomato vinaigrette\\n- Noodles\\' chicken pad Thai with flat rice noodles, chicken, egg, peanuts, bean sprouts and onions\\n- Todd English\\'s Olives\\' Tuscan farmhouse flatbread with mozzarella cheese, shaved Smithfield ham, asparagus and caramelized onions.\\n\\nAlong with the top mentioned additions, they now offer hot snow crab and Dungeness crab daily as well as a caviar station offering Ikura (salmon row), American black caviar, and red tobiko. \\n\\nAfter arrival, we paid and had been sat down pretty quickly. Decor still looks the same as it was before but they now have self-serve drink area near almost every seating area for guests to grab their own drinks, relieving a huge work load off the staff. Full customizable coke machine with juice machine, teas, and coffees. \\n\\nI was excited to go grab food so i had loaded 3 plates on the first run. 1 plate consisted of hot snow crab. Another plate was crawfish boil and butter clams. Last plate was shrimp cocktail and prime rib. \\n\\nHot snow crab. This is one of the depressing things ive seen change over the years at not only this property but all others as well. They went from whole legs to split legs. Loses a lot of the natural crab flavor and juices while adding a whole ton of saltiness from the salted water used to cook the crab. And apparently, this was already LESS salty than the cold crab ! everyone gonna walk out with elevated blood pressure due to the massive amount of salt intake from just crabs... Near the end of our meal, they changed the legs to whole legs. These legs looked much larger but what the crap?! THESE WERE MORE SALTY ! how they were able to attain this result, i have no idea. Despite this, im sure i still had 4 plates worth... They were kind of anal on how much they give. You ask for plate to be filled, they give you a \"covered plate\" of like 7 - 10 scrawny lookin legs until you ask for more. \\n\\nCrawfish. Tiny baby crawfish overcooked and drying up on the buffet line. Unlike a lot of other places that keep the crawfish in soup/broth/water, this seems like its on a hot plate steaming in its own juices, or whats left of it. \\n\\nClams were decent. The creamy butter sauce was nice. Good for dipping crab in too. \\n\\nAs mentioned before, they had a caviar station. Ikura was ok, not as fresh as it should be. Mildly deflated pearls of salmon eggs. Red tobiko is the \"firmest\" of the 3 with a mild salty flavor. The american black caviar was pretty decent. Soft pearls of caviar, lightly salted. Unfortunately, im not too much of a fan of the pancakes they put the caviar on because they were soft and made it weird Lol. I just ate the eggs off and left its vehicle. \\n\\nNo rack of lamb as some of us had hoped for but they had leg of lamb, which was fairly decent. Juicy, tender, and flavorful. WAY better than the \"prime rib\" which was overcooked and dry. \\n\\nThe Julian Serrano\\'s Malloreddus Pasta with pork sausage and tomato sauce was pretty decent. Never had screw type pasta that big which became a good vessle for carrying the sauce. \\n\\nSome other things i tried include grilled asparagus, pesto mashed potatoes, paella which were all pretty decent\\n\\nDesserts, they had a good amount of selection. I had a few creme brulee\\'s which were made really well. Super smooth and creamy but not too sweet (i take off the carmelized layer...) Had 2 of these in addition to a creamy smooth cheesecake, key lime tart, lemon meringue tart, various macarons where my friends and I tried to guess the flavor\\n\\nService, like mentioned before, the waitress had its load reduced as guests gets their own drinks, was amazing. She was really attentive and had our plates cleared fast ! ! She even cleared our shell plates and brought em back so we constantly had extra plates for shells ! Nice !!\\n\\nOverall, I mean its decent but maybe not for the price. At a discounted offer currently due to employee pricing, I still feel for the quality you are getting, its still a bit overpaid. I really wish they could return to previous quality, even if less variety is offered',\n",
       "       'Not quite sure why reviews have been slipping but I still prefer Bellagio as my favorite buffet to hit up in Vegas. The one at Bucchanal is a close 2nd though. Bucchanal charges much more to Bellagio for what they serve in terms of unique food items.\\n\\nBuffets I\\'ve been to in Vegas: Bellagio, Bucchanal (Caesars), Cravings (Mirage), Wicked Spoon, and Wynn.\\n\\nI always come here for their Chilean sea bass. I\\'m a seafoody so any buffet that serves this fish wins it for me. The last time I came here they didn\\'t have their \"Gourmet Dinner\" concept which I presume added their Beef Wellington, Kobe beef, Duck breast, Caviar, and their Alaskan King crab legs (Yes that\\'s right, not Alaskan \"Snow\" crab legs which are much cheaper in price per lb). Now let\\'s get down to what\\'s good here:\\n\\nBeef wellington was absolutely amazing here. I ate so many slices of this. Cooked perfectly to medium rare and perfect crusting wrapped around the beef tenderloin. Definitely recommending getting this item.\\n\\nKobe beef was surpisingly not that good. It was very lean and dry. We asked if we could have a more rare side but they didn\\'t offer it. Kind of surprised. So I waited for the next batch and noticed it was more red this time around so I gave it another chance but stil it was very try and tough. I was expecting a marbly piece of meat. Maybe it was incorrectly labelled. It was not the Kobe beef I was expecting at all =S Would not try this item again.\\n\\nChilean Seabass was amazing as always. Did not change one bit from the last time I came here which was about 4 years ago. It\\'s an expensive piece of fish that unfortunately other popular buffets do not serve. This again is a reason in itself to choose Bellagio buffet over the overs for those seafood lovers.\\n\\nAlaskan King Crab and Snow Crab legs were very mediorce. Starting to not appreciate the frozen then thawed crab legs. They lack the real crab taste and it\\'s super salty. I love crab legs but unfortunately it has come down to point where you need to just get them fresh to enjoy it. Frozen crab legs just don\\'t count it for me anymore; the difference in taste is far too much now.\\n\\nPrime rib is amazing as always; one of the better prime ribs served compared to the other buffets I think. They have beef juice and horseradish to go with it. I always get multiple slices of this everytime I come here. Definitely recommend trying it! Make sure it\\'s medium rare or more rare! Anything cooked above medium-rare is just a waste of meat!\\n\\nCaviar variety was okay but maybe I\\'m just not a caviar kind of guy. I tried all 3 of them caviars. Flying fish roe, Salmon roe, and Sturgeon roe (black caviar). They were all very salty and not much desired flavor. I\\'ll pass on this the next time I come here but it\\'s worth a try I guess since this is something new they added to the \"Gourmet Dinner\". I also tried their Steak Tartare which was okay. Not very appetizing though because it straight up looks like raw ground beef with some seasoning on it. Not for the faint hearted. I\\'d still give it a try since it\\'s not usually offered during their non-Gourmet meals.\\n\\nI still think this is the go-to buffet. I wouldn\\'t mind going to Bucchanal again as well but I think the Bellagio buffet had more memorable items to come back for compared to the rest.',\n",
       "       \"I have been to the Bellagio buffet at least a dozen times in the past.  It has always been the place to eat for me and my family when it comes to buffets in Las Vegas.  I brought my fiance here during our recent vacation over Labor Day weekend and it did not disappoint.  The wait was not too bad, maybe 30 minutes at 7pm on the Friday night.  I wasn't happy that they marked up the price only because it was a holiday weekend, nothing changed with the buffet that I noticed.\\n\\nOverall, the quality of the food was great, of course like with every buffet there are hits and misses.  One disappointment was their kobe beef.  Whenever you see kobe beef you think high quality meat that will melt in your mouth, well this kobe steak they advertised was grossly dry, and the slice I got was rare too!   They did have this skirt steak though, marinated in some great sauce with seasoning that was so tender, excellently prepared!  The rack of lamb was ok, had a lot of rosemary taste to it which was pleasant.  The peking duck surprisngly was very tasty.  At first we were both skeptical about the duck because the chef there didn't even seem to know how to chop it!  \\n\\nAnd of course, what we came for was perfect.  The prime rib was so rare and so tender, and well seasoned for taste.  The king crab legs, oh gosh, excellent!!  Makes me wonder why they even serve snow crab for.  Oh speaking of which, I was on my way back with dessert when I saw this guy, with a huge pile of snow crab legs, he saw the king crab legs and said something to his wife, and dumped all the snow crab back onto the pile and began hoarding king crab legs, so bad!\\n\\nThe desserts were just ok here, the creme brulee was decent, the flan was just ok, fruit tart was tasty.\\n\\nOverall, I would have give this place a 5 star rating based on the prime rib, shrimp cocktail, and king crab legs alone as these are some of the best I have ever had at any buffet.  However due to the misses and lackluster dessert and mark up of the price with nothing extra special to show for it, I will have to give it a 4 star rating.  Still, I would come back every time I am in town for just the prime rib and king crab alone!\\n\\n\\n7 - Ambiance (decent setting, dimly lit, huge layout)\\n7 - Service (dishes were cleared out promptly, slow on drink refills)\\n3 - Price (not happy the price was marked up with nothing special to show for it)\\n9 - Portions (excellent variety of quality foods)\\n9 - Quality (going off the big two of prime rib and king crab legs, fabulous)\\n\\nDinner: Fri.

       "       \"Over the weekend I had an opportunity to eat dinner at the Bellagio Buffet and also the Caesars Palace Buffet, both rated as some of the top Vegas Buffets.  I found the Bellagio Buffet having better quality food and tasting a lot better than Caesars Palace however Bellagio had a lot less of a selection of food items. Bellagio offers Caviar where Caesars charges extra for it however the Caesars caviar is of a lot higher quality. I was very disappointed by the cheese and Italian meat selection at Bellagio, very weak.  They both have basically the same crab legs and shrimp however Caesars has a lot more fish items and less meat items. I guess you can say, Bellagio offers better quality than variety.  However, the Bellagio dessert section is very weak compared to Caesars, if you are a dessert person, Caesars is the definite way to go. Bellagio was also about $10.00 less than Caesars. After seeing Caesars buffet, it made me realize that the Bellagio buffet needs a facelift, it's looking old and outdated.\",\n",
       "       \"A little disappointed - went for dinner on a Wednesday night and waited about 5 min in line before being seated.  I ate about 4 plates of food and here is what I think:\\n\\nENTREE\\n- kobe sirloin is a bit dry even though it was cooked to medium\\n- leg of lamb was pretty good and juicy, except the mint jelly was on the counter by the heat lamp so it was more like mint soup\\n- prime rib (got 2 servings cuz the first cut was rare and the second cut was medium well) -- where is the medium rare cut?\\n- crab legs - had both king crab and snow crab, nicely cut but a little bit on the salty side - can't complain about crab legs (and it's hard to mess up crab legs sitting on ice)\\n- had two different fish (one was sea bass) - it was decent\\n- ahi and salmon poke had good flavor but the fish tasted a bit mushy\\n- sauteed bakchoy was delicious (i actually ate about 6 or 7 stalks of it) - cooked just right, not too raw and not over cooked, salted just right\\n\\nsad to say the rest of the entrees didn't really interest me and I skipped the salads\\n\\nDESSERT\\none thing i enjoy most about buffets are their dessert because they come in bite-size portions and a wide variety of selection but nothing I had today was 'to-die-for' - meaning I wouldn't care for seconds.  Don't get me wrong, the stuff was good: creme brulee, flan, little creamed filled waffle cones, mille feuille, ice cream, cookies, fruit tart.  I had them all :)\\n\\nThe last time I came to Bellagio's buffet was back in 2003 on a weekend and it left a lasting memory.  So maybe it was my mind playing tricks on me after 8 years, but it wasn't as good as I had remembered.\",\n",
       "       \"Staff was friendly. Clean and attractive surroundings. Prime rib was average at best. Peak n eat shrimp were pre peaked but small. Horseradish was basically ketchup. Split crab legs both king and snow. Kings were quite small. Served cold but they'll hear them up in hot water for you. Split crab taste is nowhere near whole crab legs as the cooking process leaches out most of the flavor. Whole snow crab was the best. Cooked correctly and readily available already hot. Size of the snow crab was average and nowhere near the worth of weekend dinner prices. The cook staff were not shy about piling the crab high on your plate though that is the only way to receive them hot, as they should be served. Sushi was poor and selection was embarrassing. Desert bar was great with good quality. This place is nowhere near the price. Skip it.\",\n",
       "       \"I chose this place because I was on a mission to eat Alaskan King Crab legs, not those piddly little anemic crab legs at other Vegas hotel buffets! The cost was $32 for dinner, not including tip.\\n\\n- Excellent array and choices of food...so much in fact that your head will spin at the endless display of food, food and more food. Almost every theme and every ethic dish is represented; from American to Italian, Japanese, Chinese, Mexican, etc\\n\\n- Nice vegetable/vegetarian dish selections from mushroom cheese raviolis with essece of truflles to the most delectable of salads. They even had Tofu dishes that I found pleasantly surprising, considering most buffets do not cater to non-meat eaters. \\n\\n- the best service we've gotten at a buffet. Our server was a more older, experienced lady. She didn't rush us out when we were the last ones at the table sucking on crab legs. She got a nice hefty tip.\\n\\n- Alaskan King Crab legs, split in half for you, as were the other non-Alaskan crabs. Crab legs were on ice, cold, so I wasn't too thrilled about that. Non Alaskan crab legs were too salty to eat. The AKCLs were not as salty, meaty, but a bit watery.\\n\\n- I don't eat meat but my friend had a choice of veal, rack of lamb and venison that we didn't encounter at any of the other buffets.\\n\\n- desserts were not as good as the ones at the Aria. Disappointing was the fact that there were so many cookies for such a fancy hotel with such a fancy selection! Most people I suspect do not go for desserts anyway, but if you are looking for desserts, go to the Aria buffet.\\n\\nWould I come back for more? YES.\",\n",
       "       'After all the hype and raves, I have to say that the Bellagio dinner buffet (our first meal in Vegas), was a big disappointment.  I felt that the food selection was a little weak and the flavors and quality on the low end of the scale.  The only thing that made up for the lack of good hot food was the amazing dessert bar, which featured some insanely good desserts.\\n\\nHonestly, I can\\'t remember much of what I had, because most of it tended to be over-cooked.  The only thing that was really good was the fresh lamb/beef gyros, which were carved straight off the rotating, vertical spit.  Unfortunately, the meat was ready only every 10-15 minutes (an eternity at a buffet) and there wasn\\'t much of it each time they carved it.  You had to be fast, or the meat would run out.  Extra points for having mini-pitas and a full bar of condiments, such as sliced tomatoes, lettuce, tzatziki, and crumbled feta cheese.  I also appreciated their sushi bar, which had tuna poke and tuna sashimi, which was fresh and very good.    \\n\\nBellagio\\'s carving station offered a large variety of meats, from the standard prime rib and lamb to more \"exotic\" fare, such as bison and beef wellington, which later turned into chicken wellington.  I tried the prime rib, the bison, and the beef wellington, all of which were lacking in flavor.  The prime rib was a tad overdone, even from the center, and the seasoning, which made for a good tasting crust, didn\\'t penetrate to the center of the meat.  The bison and beef wellington were both tough and over-cooked.  It was my first time trying bison and while I think it had potential, it was just too tough for me to enjoy.  Likewise, the beef wellington, which had a good pastry crust, was too dry.\\n\\nAnd now for the desserts, which were all delicious.  The creme brulee, which I had 3 of (yes, I know, I\\'m a pig), came with a perfectly crisp, carmelized crust, which I delighted in cracking with my spoon.  Delicious.  Next up was a key lime pie - it was deliciously tart and smooth.  Likewise, the lemon meringue pie was amazing, with a nicely browned meringue on top.  There were other desserts as well, all of which were good, presumably because the man behind Jean Philippe Patisserie is overseeing all the desserts at the Bellagio.\\n\\nAll in all, an okay buffet.  The desserts were outstanding, but the other foods were a disappointment.  If you can eat $35+ worth of pastries and perhaps nibbles of sushi, gyro, cocktail shrimp, and pasta, then Bellagio is the place to go.  Otherwise, for a more complete, overall Vegas buffet experience, I would head out to the Wynn, Paris, or Mandalay Bay.',\n",
       "       \"I went to the buffet around 8:30pm on a Saturday. I could not have been more disappointed. For starters, I was excited they offer caviar since it is not an item I get to eat often. I tried the American black caviar which had very fishy taste and not in a good way. I have  tried caviar at the Ritz Carlton buffet on multiple occasions and what was provided at the Bellagio paled in comparison. Okay, let's move on to some nigiri. The sushi rice was horrid. It's temperature inferred that it had been stored in a refrigerator for quite awhile. The rice had a very gummy texture which indicated that it had been overworked in its preparation. The actual fish was average quality but in combination with the rice, made it miserable to eat.  Maybe the crayfish will be better. Nope. Other than being some of the smallest mud bugs I have seen, they had absolutely no seasoning.  Good thing the salmon cooked on the griddle??? was over cooked.....oh.....wait a sec. The Beef Wellington was cooked past medium well making the dish very dry. I also have never heard of pork Oso Bucco which was on the buffet as well. My recommendation to the chef, stick with beef!!!! A question, is any senior chef at the bellagio tasting these dishes?? The paella was a soggy mess. In fairness, the lamb was fine even though it was labeled as leg of lamb yet had rib bones attached. hmmmmmm.  At this point I gave up trying different items and left very disappointed.\",\n",
       "       \"It just didn't do it for me.  For years, the big debate seemed to be between the buffet at Caesar's and the buffet at the Bellagio for tops in Vegas.  After getting a chance to try the Bellagio buffet in February 2016, I can attest to the fact that Caesar's buffet is better.  Granted, it had been a couple years since I was at Caesar's, but I came away with very positive memory of my experience.  The Bellagio buffet is cramped and the food is underwhelming.  Yes, it does have the coveted pre-split Alaskan king crab legs.  But, they are the smallest I've ever seen.  They are served cold, not steamed.  They do have a variety of meats including a beef wellington and a kobe beef, however, the meats simply did not taste good.  The lamb chops were the exception.  The other bright spot was the caviar.  At the end of the day, I will seek other places to eat when in Vegas.\",\n",
       "       \"I read many reviews and I'm wondering if these yelpers were inhaling something when they wrote the reviews, or perhaps they were college students or very young, what kobe beef?? all the beef offerings were very tough to chew, this is not unique to Bellagio, it's the general dumbing down of all buffets to save money, in Vegas and almost all the cruise ships. I had tried all the buffets on the strip and was very disappointed the good old days were gone, Bellagio and Wynn buffets  used to be the best, I still remember fondly the amazing dining experience with my Parisian brother, he said the Bellagio feast was such a culinary delight, an experience to remember. I might have to go to Bellagio, lake Como in Italy for the old experience. We had just come back from Cinque terre so we know what a good pasta should taste like.\\nThe briskets and the tritips were still mooing, I had a bite, it was harder than my shoe leather, there were a variety of pastas but I did not see the simple spaghetti and meat balls, where were they? and why were there olives in almost every dish? not everybody liked olives, I hated them and that immediately excluded a lot of dishes for me, and what with all the weird herbs added to everything too. I'm from the old country and like herbs but not in everything, especially strong herb such as rosemary, I believe there was dill or sage added to the mayonaise, it made no sense, I have never had mayonnaise mixed with herbs, it does not go with cold cuts!!! where are the chefs at Bellagio coming from that are doing things that are not the norm elsewhere?\\nThe BBQ tasted ok but it was a tad too sweet, most dishes were too sweet, the chef must have had a sweet tooth. The shrimp cocktail was fine BUT THE COCKTAIL SAUCE WAS TOO SWEET! it killed the shrimp and the king crab legs, not only it was sweet, it did not have enough if at all horse radish, it tasted like ketchup or ketchup with added sugar, it made zero sense to me. The lemon was crushed, still frozen, there was no juice left to extract out of, we need fresh lemon! The king crab legs were not big enough, it was more like queen or baby crab legs!\\nThe plain chow mein was fine, the shrimp wonton soup was delicious, no wonder it was always out, I had to go back twice to get a bowl. \\nThe soppresata was also delicious but it also made no sense to me why it was placed next to the sweet papaya instead of mustard and mayonnaise, I went hunting for mayo and that was when i found the mayo was mixed w dill! I was looking for cornichons but there was none to be found.\\nI did not eat too many sweets, I spent too much time trying to chew the beef, we were just exhausted and wanted to go home. The deserts were pretty much tasteless, just like on the cruise ships now, no longer real whip cream, it was artificial stuffs out of a can, coloring and other subtitutes.\\nIf you want a real culinary experience I guess you would have to go to a 5 stars Michelin restaurant, not on most cruise ships (the worst offender is Royal Caribbean) and not on the Vegas strip.\",\n",
       "       \"Wow. Why did they change? This was my go to spot for gorging my face when in Vegas.  King crab legs changed to really salty snow crab legs. That's like going from Lexus to Toyota. While most everything else remain really good, shrimp cocktail, prime rib, dessert bar, the star of the show used to be Alaskan King Crab legs. Can't give it more than 3 stars. Sorry Bellagio. 42 bucks is no longer a bargain meal.\",\n",

Some of the servers were great and friendly (especially the guy chopping up the medium rare beef and pork belly) though one woman seating us rolled her eyes when my friend asked if we could wipe down the table because it had food on it. Another guy, serving the beef wellington, was really grouchy and was yelling at one of his co workers rather than letting anyone have any of his dish. I had to yell \"excuse me\" about 5 times to get his attention. The guy dishing out the caviar was also rude because I didn\\'t know the names of the different kinds. \"Can I please try the black caviar?\" I asked. His terse answer: \"UH, It\\'s called American caviar!\" I\\'ve never had caviar before and had no idea, ha ha!\\n\\nOverall, a good time and good food.

We went on the weekend for dinner and payed $40each.\\n\\nI must say that it was a huge disappointment.  I used to be a fan of the Rio seafood buffet, but it has gone way down in quality over the years so I was really looking forward to getting some King Crab legs at the Bellagio, even though it is chilled and not steamed.  \\n\\nTo my dismay, the crab was not good.  Both the King & Snow crab had no flavor and some of it actually smelled like it was bad.  But I am not basing my review on the dismal crab.\\n\\nI had read many posts about how good the Kobe beef, and the Beef Wellington were, and numerous other items that were great, and they just weren\\'t all that good.  \\n\\nThe \"Kobe\" beef tasted like dry roast beef.  The Beef Wellington was ok(never had it before), but it didn\\'t knock my socks off.  The Lamb chops were a bit gamey, and I\\'ve had lots of Lamb.  One of the best things I\\'ve ever tasted was a  Lamb Chop on the Oregon Coast, and this wasnt\\' even close.\\n\\nThe sushi smelled foul and I only could muster up the courage to try the tuna, which was about what I would expect at a low dollar buffet. \\n\\nThe only high point was the Prime Rib and the very large & tasty Peel & Eat shrimp.  The Prime Rib was very good & the au jus was also really good.  The Prime Rib isn\\'t as good as Lowry\\'s Prime Rib, but it is top notch for Buffet Prime Rib.  I\\'ve had many disappointments with buffet Prime Rib, and the Bellagio isn\\'t one of them.  \\n\\nThere were also a couple of vegitable dishes & other sides that were good, but for the price, I expected way more.  The buffet at Green Valley Ranch is a third of the cost, and the quality of the food is much better.  Not as much selection of high end stuff, but when the crab, Kobe Beef, & Sushi all suck really bad, the point becomes moot.\\n\\nI gave it two stars because between the peel & eat shrimp & the good Prime Rib, I think I got my $$ worth.',\n",

Good news is no waiting line and price is cheaper, bad news is that the choices of the food is quite limited.\\n\\nFirst of all, where does all the seafood go? There is a section for cocktail shrimp, a section for seafood salad, a couple of hot dishes for salmon and cod. Then that's pretty much it. Lobster? Crab? Oyster? Clams? None exist. Seriously it got less seafood choices than any decent buffet in any American city.\\n\\nAnd, don't get me started in the salad section. I didn't plan to feed on salad, but the choice is way too less. When I look at the few options of lettuce leaves, croutons, and dressing, I feel I was in old country buffet.\\n\\nMaybe because there are more and more Asian people coming to visit, they added sushi session and some Chinese dishes. The quality and choices of those dishes are not impressive though.\\n\\nOK, they got lots of choices for pizza and pasta. Unfortunately I seldom eat carbs expect during buffet time, so it's not attractive to me. It's common sense. Who feeds on pasta in buffet? Unless it comes with black truffle sauce, I won't eat one bite of pasta in buffet time.\\n\\nAnd the ice cream machine...seriously? Not gelato, just a pull handle ice cream machine like old country buffet? We're in Bellagio, one of the most expensive hotel in Vegas and I definitely didn't expected to see that ice cream machine here.\\n\\nI'll stop the whining and change to some positive feedbacks.\\n\\nBeef dishes are good. I tried both steak and beef brisket, both are very juicy and tender. Make sure to ask the chef to cut you thin slice though otherwise it's too thick. Talking about chef, can they smile a little bit?\\n\\nDessert section is impressive, I must admit. Tons of choices and they kept changing them. Half of my lunch I was feeding on dessert. Very colorful and beautiful, unfortunately quite rich at the same time.\\n\\nHere is something interesting, at around 4pm when we finished and about to leave, half of the guests in the eating area rushing to the seafood section and line up. It turned out that the crab legs are out and they looks pretty fresh. Too bad we're very stuffed and couldn't take another bite.

I'll sit there and eat 3-4 plates of crab legs before I make a move for the Prime Rib. =)  The crab legs were delicious and fresh.  The prime rib was soft and tender and melted in my mouth, pretty good for a buffet.  I did try a few other things that were above average, but I can't remember them right now.  The desserts were pretty good.  My gf has a big sweet tooth so she grabbed one of each and most were pretty good.

It's not because I was watching my diet or trying to fit into a sexy dress at night or saving room for something else.  It was because there was something wrong.  It just didn't taste good.  How do you screw up shrimp cocktail?  \\n\\nNext, the crab wasn't that good.  Usually I can eat at least 5 plates of stacked crab legs.  I mean, 5 points for cutting the king crab legs in half so you don't have to work on cracking them and getting angry and cutting your fingers trying to eat faster.  But the quality just wasn't there.  I'd rather have to crack my crab so that I could eat something tastier.  It was dry, and a hit or miss.  Probably frozen for too long.  Not fresh.  \\n\\nThird, the sashimi was disgusting.  Is this what Americans think sashimi is like?  NOT fresh at all.  I couldn't eat the plate I got because I had this fear of eating bad fish.  And having eaten bad fish at one point in my life, it definitely was NOT worth the risk.  I had some spicy tuna, but come on, SPICY TUNA??? \\n\\nNext, the kobe beef wasn't kobe at all.  Why call it kobe??? Just call it beef jerky.  \\n\\nThe chilean bass was pretty good.  I can't believe i had something to eat.  Oh, the pesto mashed potatoes were pretty good, but come on, I'm here for seafood.  Not potatoes.  \\n\\nThere were no king crab claws like at rio. \\n\\nSkipped the carb dishes like bread, pastas, etc.  Not coming back.  \\n\\nTwo stars because dessert was pretty good.

Everything was top notch and could have been a star at any restaurant. Had beef short ribs, Kobe beef, ostrich, killer pastas and other sides. There were chefs making the food right in front of you. We just went last weekend and we got over cooked prime rib, over cooked pork loin, over cooked lamb, over cooked beef ribs. The sides were just as bad.  The main starch was runny mashed potatoes(you can get these at old country buffet).  Just all over cooked food that was obviously not done by chefs, but instead by cheaply paid line cooks. Very very disappointing.  Not close to being worth the cost any more. Roasted pork loin and plain ole mashed taters(poorly done) should not be on a buffet you are dropping 50 bucks on.  You can tell that the bottom line is way more important than the quality food they use to put out. Will not go back again.',\n",
       "       'My gf suggested we eat here because they have \"better\" food, which I suppose is implied by the higher price they charge for dinner. \\n\\nThis is not the case. \\n\\nWhen you\\'re in Vegas (or anywhere, really) you have to remember that a buffet is a buffet is a buffet. \\n\\nSure, they\\'ve got Kobe (not really, we aren\\'t in Japan) beef, lamb, sushi, Alaskan king crab legs, snow crab, flank steak, shrimp cocktail...\\n\\n... but it all tastes like buffet quality food, which is a better way of saying they\\'re mostly terrible. \\n\\nDo you know how difficult it must be to coordinate a meal big enough to feed hundreds, if not thousands, or people? Do you possibly think quality can be a factor in cooking these meals?\\n\\nWhere is the satisfaction in getting a thick slice of Kobe beef if it\\'s so tough your knife can\\'t get through it?\\n\\nLike king crab legs? Then you\\'ll hate them here, since they\\'re all machine-cut, partially frozen, and it tastes like they\\'ve been sitting in a salt water bath for a week. \\n\\nI wouldn\\'t even mess with the sushi. I\\'m very, very picky about my fish, and whatever they were serving here looked one step above the grocery store. \\n\\nEven the desserts were mediocre. \\n\\nIf you want to eat well in Vegas, go look up a decent restaurant and drop the $70 you\\'d spend here there. This last (and I do mean LAST) buffet visit proved once and for all that no matter what they\\'re serving or charging, nothing beats paying for freshly made food. It isn\\'t worth cramming sub-par servings down your gullet just to justify the cost of what you paid to get in here. Unless you have no discerning tastes, or you\\'re just a big fatty who loves to binge eat (hey, no judgment here... do your thing) then this just isn\\'t the place to waste money in Vegas.',\n",
       "       'First off, from Christmas to New Years the price goes up to around $50 a head - almost 50% for what looks like the same food that they normally serve.  Crab legs are split in half which makes it difficult to separate the meat from the cartilage.  They\\'re also served frozen, and when I mean frozen expect more ice crystals in your mouth than tasty meat.  FAIL.  The \"Kobe\" beef was served almost well done which would be sacrilege if it actually were real Kobe beef.  The Prime Rib was actually the tastiest meat I had.  I forget which piece of fish I grabbed, but it had the juiciness and consistency of cardboard so I didn\\'t bother with any other fish.  The mussel dishes were also pretty gross - overcooked and dry.  Most of the rest that I tried was pretty average for a casino buffet, nothing that justified the Bellagio premium or the holiday ripoff rate.  I for one will never be returning.',\n",

The crab legs were pretty salty and didn't have much meat. The broccoli was also pretty salty. The shrimp ravioli was a complete joke because it literally contained a tiny piece of shrimp (I'll include a photo for y'all to see). The Bobby pizza was decent, basically had cranberry sauce and turkey chunks. The grilled salmon with the truffle oil was pretty tasty and crispy, but they weren't really making too many of them because they were probably busy doing other things. The California rolls and the tempura rolls did not taste good at all. I decided to stay away from the nigiri and poke because the fish slices did not look fresh. \\n\\nOverall I was pretty disappointed with my Thanksgiving dinner at this buffet. Pretty much paid $55 per person for a sad selection of food with poor flavor and lots of saltiness. I eat on the strip pretty often and this is one place I may avoid in the future.\",\n",

A lot of the food, such as the cooked veggies, creamed corn, pizza looked cold and were not that fresh. I usually stay away from food that doesn't look good, because I don't want to get sick from eating it. The fish, turkey, New York strip were definitely over cooked and super dry. I ate one piece and just left it on my plate. The chicken was pretty good though, very moist and flavorful. \\n\\nThere is a wide selection of desserts if you have a sweet tooth. My favorite was the cheesecake. \\n\\nThere is a Coca Cola soda machine where you can make a unique drink for yourself. There is also a juice dispenser. Drinks are available on both sides of the buffet. The first juice dispenser we went to, our orange juice and cranberry juice came out tasting like water. Not sure if they keep track or check if the machine is full or not? The other drink station had orange juice tasting like orange juice. \\n\\nWorkers were very friendly and attentive though.

First of all, I\\'ve had kobe beef ny strip steaks. You\\'re probably looking at $90+ for a 12 oz steak. Whatever they were serving had no marbling of fat throughout the meat and it was dry and over cooked. Unfortunately, this steak was shadowed by their flank steak, which was much better prepared and more flavorful.\\n\\nAnyway, they also had king crab legs, snow crab legs, rack of lamb, and chilean sea bass, to name a few other favorites. Overall, the food quality was good, and the variety that the buffet offers definitely is appropriate for the amount that you pay. I might add that you might want to stay away from the sushi bar though - really the only part I\\'d say wasn\\'t very good.\\n\\nMy only advice is you definitely want to save room for dessert.

I think I ate over 20 legs by myself.....They do a very good job of restocking so you will never have to worry about fighting for those legs.\\n\\nIn terms of sushi, their selections were very limited. However, I was very impressed with the quality of their fish. Their salmon and tuna sashimi pieces were very fresh, thick, and clean.\\n\\nEverything else here tastes just mediocre in my opinion. I tried their pork ribs, prime cuts, and etc. but they tasted average. There wasn't any particular dish that really jumped out at me.\\n\\nI did love their dessert section. They had a lot of different variety of desserts and for someone who doesn't like sweet stuff, I was impressed that I ended up eating all my dessert.\\n\\nSo essentially, if you want to stuff yourself with some delicious king crab legs and delicious sashimi pieces, you will definitely want to check this place out.

       "       \"Now this is what I call a meal. After eating lunch at the disappointment that was Pho at TI, I was definitely ready for some real food. The Bellagio buffet has been known to be one of the best buffets in Vegas. I don't think I've been here for dinner so I was pretty excited. My first surprise was actually the price. $45 for dinner is pretty hefty, even for a buffet, but I just thought of that as a challenge to eat my worth of king crab legs and meat for the price of entrance. \\n\\nAfter we were seated, I went straight for the king crab legs, which always seems to be in season here. They were good as always and I probably polished off a dozen or so. Moving on, I skipped all the other food sections and went straight for the carving station. Tonight, they had rack of lamb, ostrich, and roasted duck breast. The rack of lamb lollipops were definitely the highlight of the meal. They were cooked perfectly and the taste was fancy restaurant quality. I think I finished half a dozen of those before trying some ostrich and the duck breast. The duck breast was also very flavorful, but the meat was actually a little bit on the tough side. \\n\\nThere were also a ton of other dishes that were quite impressive. I had an affinity for the mushroom ravioli with truffle essence, which was a winner over the lobster ravioli. The cocktail shrimp and smoked salmon were also my winners. I think the other only thing I remember that was good was the tiny ramekin with mac and cheese. \\n\\nThe one thing that I was disappointed by was dessert. The offerings were just not that impressive and they didn't even have real ice cream. Soft serve isn't acceptable at a buffet as nice as Bellagio's. I will say that I did enjoy the sour cream cheesecake, which was probably my favorite out of the group. My impression for dinner was that it was good for a buffet, but it could have been a bit better.\",\n",

I gathered all the pretty desserts that would fit on a plate: macaroons, eclairs, tarts and a chocolate covered strawberry... but it was all so mediocre... Most items only got one bite from me.

The prime rib and the ribs fell flat, but the rest was very tasty - especially the lamb.  I love that they have all of the necessary condiments: mustard, mint jelly, au jus, horseradish, etc...\\n\\nI never eat pizza at a buffet - filler - but the pizza here is very good.  The truffle pizza and the beet/goat cheese were the best.  Some of the specialty salads here were good, but the other sides were just okay.  The big draws here are defiantly the carving stations and the seafood.\\n\\nWhere everything starts to fall apart, is with the dessert.  Ugh.  Really bad 90s era soft-serve and super sweet cakes/cookies.  I just can't give it the full five stars until they upgrade that section.\",\n",
       "       \"I'd actually go with 3.5 stars if I could, but for once, I am glad I can't because it wouldn't be fair to the business.  Here's the thing - my girlfriend and I had just finished the rock n roll half marathon and wanted to eat.  Our original plans were to grab 1 buffet this weekend, and it was not going to be this one.  Unfortunately, the one we wanted to go to was closing by the time the race ended (we were planning on going a couple days prior, but circumstances required us to skip it).  Therefore, we were trying to decide between the Bacchanal Buffet at Caesars, or this one.  We chose this one because although we loved the one at Caesars when we were last in Vegas, we wanted to try a new one.  Therefore, we came here.  However, we realized after we paid that we had been here before (we didn't remember going to 2 buffets our last trip) and therefore, should have gone to Caesars, which we preferred, but it was too late.  Therefore, I didn't enjoy it as much as I would have because I was disappointed in the decision to come here in the first place.\\n\\nAs I said, that's not really fair though because the Bellagio has a really good buffet.  Is it as good as Caesars?  Nope, but it has plenty of options and it's all high quality and very tasty.  It's funny, but you are actually not that starving after a long distance run.  I thought I would be, but until your muscles relax, everything is so tight that you can't eat as much.  Therefore, I wasn't able to eat as much as I wanted to.  Nevertheless, I did enjoy one plate full of carved turkey, rotisserie chicken, carved ham, kobe beef, and some potatoes.  Also had another plate of some Asian food and crab legs, and finally, 2 bowls of won ton soup, which was probably the best item (sooooooooooo deliciously salty!).\\n\\nIf I had to complain about something - and lets face it, if you know me, then you know I have to complain about a lot of things - it would be the dessert.  Firstly, no cookies?  How do you not have trays of cookies?  Secondly, a lot of the desserts were just disappointing.  No apple pie or cobbler, only 1 or 2 cheesecake options, no brownies.  They did have mini key lime pies, so there was that, and they also had ice cream, but it was 35 degrees out, so screw that.\\n\\nAlso, the buffet at Caesars serves things in little tapas plates.  So rather than you heaping loads of food you won't finish onto your plate, Caesar's controls the portions.  You can always grab more than one, or go back for more, but if I had to wager, I would say that Caesar's system wastes less food.  If you give me two buffets, and I can eat as much as I want - to the point of bursting and making a disgusting mess - at both, and both serve high quality delicious food, but one wastes less, then I'll go with that one.  Also, if I am being honest, Caesar's has better options, too.\\n\\nBut, just because Caesar's is better doesn't mean Bellagio is bad.  Heck, go to both.  Apparently, I did, but I ate so much I broke my memory.\",\n",
       "       'Been to this Brunch buffet about six years ago and must have had a great experience as it still stuck in my memory. \\nWent two days before Christmas 2013 and found the dinner price at $48 per person.  Not cheap. While King Crab Legs in theory sound fantastic, what was offered was inedible.  Half of it was still frozen.  The thawed out pieces must have been thawed once before then absorbed too much water then got refrozen as they were saturated in liquid making them rubbery and bland.  \\nKobe beef should be fork tender, but my knife was unable to cut trough. Overall, low quality  ingredients and amateur execution.  Highlights were the pork ribs, the marinated tuna sashimi and the crème brûlée on the desert table. \\nRather disappointing!',\n",

       "       \"Ate here on a Monday evening.  Not a lot of selections.  Paella was very bland.  King crab legs were tiny and only available cold.  Snow crab legs were warm, but those were soaked too long in water and tasted sterile.  The sushi station had Marty's caviar, salmon, and tuna.  Decent selection of dessert including panna cotta, a few ice cream and sorbet flavors, and fruits.  No leche flan.\",\n",
       "       \"I wasn't very impressed with this place. But for the price of $27 per person (on weekends), it was just ok. Selection isn't as grand as the Wynn buffet, but again, you get what you pay for. Although I have to say, if anyone who has been to the buffet at  Barona Casino in San Diego, you'll have a better time there at half the price!\\n\\nThe Italian portion of the buffet: most of the pasta was over-sauced or dried up, but that's always the issue when pasta is left out for a while. Japanese side? Sushi is decent, but again, I've had way better. Their side dishes were over salted or overly spicy, which made the dishes seemingly unauthentic. I have to say though, the seafood was fresh, but there weren't any crab legs when I was there so I only grabbed a few shrimps. Fresh and sweet! The American side: mostly the prime rib to critique. It's a small slice and I was pleased it was small because I wouldn't have eaten anymore of it. It was difficult to cut, especially since I was cutting with what felt like a butter knife. Seasoning was lacking, but cooked to a nice medium rare. And as for my favorite part of buffets, the desserts? I was happy with the variety, but unhappy that they looked better than they tasted. I sampled about half of the options, and most of them were too sweet or too creamy or too dry. \\n\\nI know that this is one of the more affordable buffets in Vegas and as a poor college student, we always try find ways of cutting corners and saving a bit. But if you're looking for a real Vegas place, skip this place. I still have yet to find THE best buffet in Vegas because no one ever wants to go to the clubs bloated afterwards. So maybe another time I'll come to Vegas just to eat buffets!\\n\\nNothing special, pass!\",\n",

Snow crab legs VS Alaskan crab legs - I choose snow crab legs over Alaskan any day.. the meat is more tender, less salty, and tastes better with butter.\\n2. Sushi - only the salmon is worth eating at a buffet\\n3. Prime rib with a cup of ah ju sauce\\n4. Jumbo shrimp cocktails, probably the best on the strip with their plump sizes\\n5. Lamb chops \\n6. DESSERT - I always grab a serving of everything... a bite or two of most and completely devouring the good ones. \\n7.

Back then, the food was amazing so I guess I can see why its much better on the weekends.\\n\\nThey had chicken wellington, but it was too dry for my taste. I helped myself to a lot salmon nigiri, but the rice was too pasty. I do like how the slab of salmon is just right and not too puny like at the Mirage. They had this cooking station that made this French dish where you pick your seafood, veggies, and type of sauce poured onto the kind of bread used for wellington. My creation consisted of salmon, scallops, and shrimp mixed with onions, tomatoes, peppers. All of the following were stir fried then mixed in with pesto sauce. I don't remember the actual name of the dish, but it was one of the very few things I enjoyed. That and the pesto mashed potatoes. Hmmm, I guess I have a thing for pesto sauce. \\n\\nBesides the dishes I just mentioned, my meal wasn't that memorable. For 29 doll hairs I expected better. Not bad, but not that great.

       "       \"Bellagio have always been one of the better buffet, especially famous for their prime rib. Just got out of lunch buffet today, very disappointed. I felt totally ripped off at $38 per person with the selection and quality of food they have now. First, the prime rib is half the size of what it used to be, plus it's over cooked and super tough. King crab, snow crab, caviar, salmon/tuna sushi all no where to be found today. The pork ribs and fish are all dryer out and under seasoned. The remaining selection is all breakfast stuff like pancakes, waffle, bacon and eggs. That's what you call holiday gourmet lunch buffet? Bellagio, come on, your buffet is not what it used to be, I rather go back to Aria next door.\",\n",

However, I did like their selection and the unique dishes that were offered. Prime ribs would have been great if it was fresh and hot.  Asian Food selection looked really smushy and gross. Italian section looked decent with their variety of pasta and pizza. Sushi was really really fresh which was very surprising! Don't judge me but the only thing I found exciting was the Shrimp Ceasar Salad and the selection of desserts. I'm pretty disappointed of myself that we came here late and spent $40 a person for cold food. Service was good. Our plates were gone by the time we came back. Maybe the next time will be better.

They also have other interesting meats during their gourmet dinners such as Kobe beef, tri tip, ostrich, beef wellington, rotisserie chicken...the list goes on and on. \\n\\nThe other options at Bellagio are good.  Typical pizza & italian dishes.  Decent asian food. Nothing that stands out too much.

You can add a bunch of different items such as shrimp, mushrooms, onions, tomatoes and then have a tomato based sauce or a pesto sauce.  There are bunch of other things you can add to this I just can't remember what else was available.  But the sauce on this thing is TO DIE FOR.

I started with salmon poke, tuna poke, salmon and tuna nigri, and fresh pineapple. The flavors were spot on and super fresh. My next course was rack of lamb, brussel sprouts, and a salmon mouse tartlet. The lamb was cooked perfectly, moist, tender and meaty with the required  (for me at least ) mint jelly. After this I decided to have a little more salmon and tuna poke and try some caviar. They offered 3 types of caviar with an array of toppings; I had mine with a little chopped egg; again I was not disappointed. (Sorry, I forgot the types of caviar; I wasn't planning on writing a review.)\\nMy final venture was the desserts. I tried the pumpkin pie tart and the lemon merengue tart. They were the perfect end to a very satisfying meal. I will definitely go back so I can try some of the other yummy looking things that were available.

       "       \"Although pricey, I really enjoy the Bellagio buffet because their offerings are more creative, gourmet, and upscale than other buffets I've been to.  For example, they offered Kobe top sirloin when I was there, which was absolutely delicious.  They also had a station where they cooked-to-order a dish made of seafood, vegetables, and puff pastry with a cream sauce.  Other notable items were the pesto mashed potatoes and the lobster ravioli.  I also really like their pre-made salad station--I tried the one with mixed greens, pecans, cranberries, and a maple dressing, and it was so good that I would have been happy just eating that the whole time.  Their dessert selection is just out of this world, but unfortunately I was too full to try any!\\n\\nOne downside for me was the price, which ended up being $45 after tax and gratuity (automatic 18% gratuity added for parties of 8 or more).  The other downside, which some may disagree with, is how they split the crab legs for you.  I, personally, like having the experience of working through crab legs.  When all the work had been done for you, you focus more on the taste of the crab which I found too salty.  Regardless, I still see myself coming back next time I come to Vegas.\",\n",

Also, the smoked salmon are buttery soft and comes in generously sized fatty portions! However, other dishes aren't unique or tasty enough to make the buffet stand out from the others. They have a Kobe beef roast that I was very excited about, but it was so very over cooked. There was barely any pink in the steak and the meat was hard - like beef jerky hard. Now that's a waste of Kobe beef. Then there was sand in the cooked vegetables, and the miso soup was too salty.

Everything I had was great, especially the kobe steak, porterhouse steak, lamb shanks, ahi nigiri, and beef bourguignon, beef wellington. Which leads me to my next bit of advise: if you go to this buffet, be a carnivore. It is probably not worth it if you are a vegetarian or vegan.

My recollection of the Bellagio buffet was that it had pretty amazing food...the Beef Wellington and Chilean Sea Bass were particularly memorable last time. It seemed like it would be a bargain at this price. What I didn't count on was that they would charge my four year old a FULL adult admission. Oh, and since it was Friday, it would be $40 each. \\n\\nWell, the food was not nearly as good this time around...dish for dish, the Caesars buffet was far better. The only thing was that the Bellagio had King Crab legs, though they didn't seem properly defrosted and were quite waterlogged.

       "       \"I'd been to the buffet at Paris: not impressed. The buffet at Mirage: definitely not impressed. The buffets at Wynn - all three meals: somewhat more impressed, but not enough to return. I decided buffets were not for me.\\n\\nSo what happened? As luck would have it, I ended up in Las Vegas at the same time that my brother was visiting. We have different tastes in restaurants, and a buffet seemed like a good compromise. He thought Bellagio was pretty good, so off we went.\\n\\nThe buffet area is busy and not particularly pretty. It feels a lot like an upscale cafeteria - not bad, but lacking character. No big deal. Service was fine, with drinks coming quickly, and dirty plates being cleared quickly. I still haven't figured out how buffet staff know not to give your table away when you get up to get seconds (and thirds and...), but somehow it works.\\n\\nCompared to Wynn, the selection at Bellagio is smaller, and the overall quality is about the same. However, Bellagio has a few dishes that are more interesting, or of better quality. The evening I was there, the standouts were:\\n     Beef Wellington with Bearnaise Sauce. The pastry crust was reasonably flaky, the beef was tender, and the sauce was good. I went back for seconds.\\n     African Bluenose. Some sort of firm white fish, it was fully cooked but still juicy.\\n     Whole Quail. There really wasn't anything special about the quality, but I give the buffet extra points for offering something a little different.\\n     Desserts. The variety of desserts is small, but I'm a sucker for rich chocolate offerings, and there were several that featured ganache or other chocolate fillings. The creme brulee was also good.\\n\\nThere were plenty of other items that were nothing special (e.g., marinated squid that was pretty standard, curried duck that didn't have much flavor, dried out gyro meat). Nonetheless, I give Bellagio the nod over my prior favorite buffet - Wynn - because Bellagio's offerings are a little more interesting. I still think buffets aren't worth it, but if you want to try a dinner buffet, this one is a good choice.\\n\\nBecause of this experience, I went back for the lunch buffet. I should have stuck with dinner. The lunch buffet was very similar to the dinner buffet - minus the more interesting or better dishes. Beef welling at dinner was replaced by very mediocre Chicken Wellington at lunch. African bluenose, cooked so nicely at dinner, was dry at lunch.

I did my best to eat some of each but fell short by 65%.  Yes, one could eat there till they were stuffed for 3 or 4 nights and try new items continually.  \\n\\nThe dishes were decent.  I tried a few pasta dishes the were good but not stupendous.  They had a peking duck that was tremendous.  Loved it and a few of the vegetable plates also.  The prime rib looked great along with the carved poltry.\\n\\nThe real disappointment was the snow crab legs.  They cheesily called them king crab legs and they tasted more like dry flavorless sea legs left on the counter overnight and you had to wedge it off with a chisle.  Nobody ate them on the table.  They were as bad as the desert line up.  Frozen sheets of favorless cake with a name like cheese cake.  No resemblance.  \\n\\nNothing you'll regret but surely nothing to brag about.  Not far different than the MGM buffet.\",\n",

The buffet comes with free soft drinks/beverages so I loaded up on fresh squeezed orange juice and coffee and they are of surprisingly good quality. The brunch also has tons of king crab legs, roasted lamb, prime ribs and tons of desserts. It is about $36 a person so after tax and tip it comes out to just north of $40. \\n\\nTo be fair, not everything here is top notch. They have excellent king crab legs as they are fresh and never seem to run out. The prime ribs are pretty good although I did not taste it myself. The roasted lamb has great flavor but is a little tough for my taste. I am more of a medium rare type of girl. I really enjoy their fresh custom made omelet. The things that are mediocre are their dim sum and sushi. There are not a lot of varieties. \\n\\nDessert section is where I loaded up and found some of the cheese cakes and flan to be very delicious. The cookies and macarons are well made too as well as their bread pudding. There is also soft serve available if you have the stomach for it still after all the entree. \\n\\nOverall, it is a solid buffet with tons of fresh dishes to eat and desserts to satisfy your sweet tooth.

King crab, snow crab, caviar, salmon/tuna sushi all no where to be found today. The pork ribs and fish are all dryer out and under seasoned.

Lots of times you go to a buffet and it's snow crab, but this one was Alaskan king crab.  The great thing was that it was already sliced in half.  So we just had to dig it out of the shell (which my friend's hubby did for all of us).

Having just left there though, I must admit I'm pretty disappointed. \\n\\nWe arrived at 2pm on a Thursday and the line reached the telephones outside the restaurant.  It moved pretty steadily though, and my party of 4 was seated in 40 minutes.  In general, the service was pretty sloppy.  There were times when up to 6 dirty plates were piled up on our table and aside from iced tea, which they filled pretty regularly, I had to flag someone down to get another drink.\\n\\nFrom the carving stations, I tried the flank steak, kobe, prime rib, chicken, and ribs.  The flank was marinated wonderfully and the ribs were awesome, but everything else was pretty meh, either over or undercooked.\\n\\nThe shrimp were plentiful and tasty, plus come pre-shelled.  The crab legs didn't come out until dinner and the line to get them was maybe 15 deep at first, but died down after about half an hour.  Tonight had both snow and king.  I didn't appreciate the fact that they're cut in half as much as I expected - you usually can't pull the meat out in one piece because there's a layer of cartilage in the middle.  Also, they didn't do a very good job defrosting them since most of my legs still had chunks of ice in them, but you can ask someone behind the counter to heat them up for you.\\n\\nThe lunch sushi options are pretty bare, but sashimi comes out at dinnertime.  Although I've seen ads of the buffet having dim sum, they only had BBQ pork buns.  I think there were four types of pasta and all but one was vegetarian.  The tortellini was really good.  I was also a fan of the pesto mashed potatoes.\\n\\nThe salad bar had a few premade salads, my favorite being the spinach and bacon one.  During lunch it had a bunch of deli meats and cheese, but they were taken away for dinner.  The mozzarella balls are a must-try!\\n\\nThe dessert station had about 30 options, all beautifully made and each approximately two-bite-size.  About 20 of them were little tarts or cakes, and then there was bread pudding, brownies, and cookies.  I saw three sugar-free options.  I probably shared about 10 desserts with my mom.  Everything was pretty good, but my favorites were the cheesecake, creme brulee, and key lime tart.  My sister was a huge fan of the fruit tarts and ate about six.\\n\\nAll in all, I felt like I got my $19.99 worth for lunch, but I don't know if it's worth the $29.99 for dinner.  However, given that it's generally ranked one of the top three buffets in Vegas, I feel like it's a bit overrated.

It was not seasoned well, and I think bambi was still fighting for his last breath, because he seemed to be pulsating a bit. \\n     Bambi aside, i also tried three different versions of veal, all of which were very good, if a bit light on the seasoning.

It's rare that I find crab of this quality. I find the prime rib equally prepared, cooked to a perfectly medium rare. The various pork and chicken dishes were excellent. Of the vegetable sides I sampled the mashed potatoes (real potatoes), green beans, corn, salad, etc., all were delicious. Of the few breads I sampled were also very good. In short this was a buffet that really was one of the best meals I had had in quite a while, I left satisfied and overstuffed. \\n\\nNow the bad, at just under $40 it's quite expensive.

It does not exude \"fancy\" as the Bellagio should. Even the buffet at the Wynn (which isn\\'t great) served prime rib. The chicken sausage at the Bellagio was flavorless.

They have a good selection of the 'basics' that one might expect at a buffet: king crab legs, snow crab legs, stone crab claws (these were overcooked though), prime rib, turkey, and a pretty good dessert selection. I pretty much just stocked up on king crab legs all night while trying the prime rib and hangar steak. The other nice offering here is the caviar, which was pretty darned good (the Tobiko in particular). Their sushi selection is decent and the tuna was pretty fresh too. \\nDessert was good - they have a large selection of stuff as well as soft serve machines with really good sorbet and custard. Cheaper than Bacchanal and Wicked Spoon but smaller in size. You can't go wrong if you just want no-frills and if you're ok with a smaller selection. I'd probably need to make my rounds at all the remaining major buffets in Vegas before I decide which one I like out of all of them. \\nJust FYI: they tack on an 18% gratuity charge since our party was bigger than 8.\",\n",

There were some odd dishes and some dishes with very poor quality control which is why this place doesn't get a 5 star. They had a nice selection of desserts, but not the best overall quality.

And also, it's not a good idea to be starving and eating at a buffet...\\n\\nThe cost was $45 for lunch which isn't too bad. But I think Bacchanal has more options for the same price. They have an assortment of meat like turkey, chicken, ribs, steak, quail and lamb. I definitely recommend the lamb because it was super moist and cooked to perfection. More often than not, the steak gets overcooked and is rather dry. The quail wasn't bad either. In terms of seafood, they have king crab and snow crab legs, salmon and tuna poke, clams, mussels and seafood salads. Seafood is always the way to make the most out of what you paid! I just wish they had more options. The salmon poke was one of my favorites as well. Dessert here is really good too and I recommend the watermelon panna cotta and the cappuccino dessert (if they have it). They also have a taco bar, macaroni salad, mashed potatoes and mixed vegetables.\\n\\nIf I was in the area, I would come here again but I still prefer Bacchanal more (since they have oysters and tastier dishes).

To be fair, the sushi fish was decent, and I asked for a plate of just the sashimi, but they said I had to take the lumpy, sloppily crafted nigiri off the serving plates and then I felt bad leaving the rice balls uneaten to be thrown away so I just moved on to something else. I mean, the rice had hard, crunchy grains in it. Yuck.\\n\\nThe best offerings (and the reason this isn\\'t a one-star review) were the pesto shrimp pizza, beef ravioli in mushroom cream sauce, pesto tortellini, and the desserts.

Met bro and sis-in-law at the buffet after looking at the Christmas decorations in the conservatory.  Bellagio always has a beautiful holiday set-up with flowers, model train set, large decorated tree, flowered polar bear, etc... After walking through the conservatory and taking the obligatory selfies, we headed to the buffet to stuff our tummies.\\n\\nWell, this buffet had all of the same items from the prior Casino buffets, Snow Crab Legs, Prime Rib, Boiled Shrimp, Salad Bar, Dessert Bar, etc... Thus, I will mention the unique items only... Salmon Pate Petit Four, Salmon Poke, Tuna Poke, Beef Tartar, Spicy Tuna Handroll, Watermelon and Watercress Salad, Asian Pears, etc...  Funny thing... I actually tried all of those different items since I had my fill of Crab Legs, Prime Rib, etc. from all of the other buffets.\\n\\nRecommend this buffet for the unique items.  Decor is dated and there is no natural lighting since there are no windows.  Done with buffets for awhile...  Don't have to watch diners with plates piled high with Snow Crab Legs....\",\n",
       "       \"Although everything at the Buffet at Bellagio was fairly good, it fell short of my expectations. At Bellagio I would expect a truly upscale or distinctive experience, even in the buffet.  Instead, I found myself in a buffet that was above average, but with nothing remarkable.  The buffet has crab legs, but they are snow crab, not king crab, and average quality.  The sushi was tasty, but hastily made in bulk with shoddy presentation. The pasta dishes were probably my favorite part, with a good variety of filled and long pastas in creative sauces and presentations.  The dessert pastries were also good, but no better than you'd find in any mid-range buffet.  Finally, the biggest disappointment: a soft-serve ice cream dispenser.  At Bellagio I would have expected a gelato bar or hard serve ice cream parlor.\\n\\nIn summary, if you go there expecting an average buffet, and you don't mind paying more for location, this buffet delivers.  Everything was good or above-average, but nothing was great.  If you're expecting a distinctive or outstanding experience, you won't find it here.\",\n",

There is something for everyone and new trays of food are constantly being cranked out. The food is good, middle of the road for the most part. Definitely not super high quality like the Wicked Spoon at the Cosmopolitan, but it is passable for the ~$50 price of admission on the weekend. Our waitress was very prompt at removing our dirty plates and refilling our supply of wet naps.\\n\\nThe most recent addition which pushes them to four stars is the installation of multiple Coke Freestyle machines. In previous years, my gripe with this buffet was always the slow speed of service with drink refills. This is no longer an issue and we did not have any issues with machines being out of flavors.',\n",

Saturday is their \"gourmet\" buffet and you get some extras like beef wellington (pretty good) and lamb chops.  There are also selections of venison and prime rib but both were incredibly bad and overcooked or RAW, not rare.  I\\'ve never seen snow crab at the B buffet so I\\'m guessing they were new.  They also had the usual king crab legs but both the king and snow were partially frozen and TINY.  I\\'m sure if our party had gone earlier, we would have been able to get the bigger, more meaty ones but oh well.  For a first timer, the buffet would be good but coming back to eat again would be really difficult to justify the $40+ price tag.  Even on a comp, I would probably prefer to have an enjoyable more peaceful meal at the CAFE!',\n",
       "       \"This is probably my favorite buffet I've been to on The Strip. The buffet is one of the simpler looking buffets compared to the other buffets of it's caliber in the area. It's also the cheaper option for the quality of food you get (imo), w/ lunch priced at $22 and dinner at around $37 (both + tax) on the weekdays. And heads up this is a review of their weekday menu, not their weekend (which I understand comes with more items and a higher price).\\n\\nThe service is good. The variety is standard. That is, they have salad, sushi, cold bar, prime rib, chicken, turkey, a semblance of chinese food, pizza, pasta, seafood, dessert, etc. If you're looking for something totally out there and exotic your'e not going to find it at this buffet (and I don't why you'd look at buffets for that type of stuff anyways). If you want more variety buffets such as the Bacchanal at Caesars will be for you. However, the reason why they're my favorite buffet is because of the food. \\n\\nThe Good: \\n1.) The prime rib here is the best between Bacchanal, Wynn, and Bellagio. They're smaller, but from what I've seen and eaten the prime rib is better seasoned and cooked better than the other buffets. \\n2.) Lamb lollipops. The first 2 batches were really good with the proper medium rare available, but alas as time went on they overcooked it consistently.\\n3.) The sea bass, which was tender and had decent flavor. \\n4.) Smoked salmon is offered both lunch and dinner\\n5.) There were split King Crab legs on a weekday dinner. Score!\\n\\nThe Whatever/Bad:\\nSushi was whatever to bad (per-the-usual) Turkey was going on dry, but okay, the rotisserie chicken was decent, and dessert was also decent, but mostly whatever. I mostly avoid the Chinese line (at all the buffets there) and you need to check to make sure the piece of fish you are grabbing is overcooked or not. My method, poke it with the tongs. If it flakes easily than take it, if it is solid, its overcooked.\\n\\nIn short, the Bellagio may not have the most varied, exotic selection, or the prettiest decor, but they make food that I want to eat and do enough of it well that I'd want to come back. That and the price is pretty affordable to cheap if you're looking for a good upscale buffet to eat at.\",\n",

For $30+ a person I was expecting fairly decent food. The crab legs were super salty and everything else was bland and unmemorable. I can honestly say that I prefer the cheap Asian buffets over Bellagio's. As for the dessert selection, which could've been its saving grace since I have a major sweet tooth, it was also a huge let down.

NONE of us found anything that we liked to eat and we left feeling unsatisfied and not even full! A lot of the food tasted over-salted but it was especially noticeable in the crab legs. It was nice that they were pre-cut, but was it really necessary to pour a whole shaker of salt on it?? \\n\\nOne of my friends unfortunately got food poisoning at the buffet, most likely from the sushi (the only thing he ate that we didn't) which spoiled our evening because he needed to be near a bathroom.\\n\\nI was VERY upset at their dessert selection. All of the cream/mousses tasted watered down, everything had the wrong texture or taste and there was only one decent dessert. It was this nutella in a cone with some orange on it. But it is pretty hard to go wrong when there's nutella. \\n\\nEven though the price was decent for a dinner buffet, with other buffet options available in vegas, Bellagio's dinner buffet is definitely not worth trying.\",\n",

From lunch to dinner, there wasn't that big of a difference except they did bring out the snow crab legs and crawfish and took away the breakfast items. Also the meats changed and they took away the BBQ ribs and came out with the prime rib. \\n\\nThe sushi at any buffet was just below average but I did like the poke especially the salmon poke with the spicy mayo sauce on the side (dinner item?). Meats were good and I especially loved the BBQ ribs from lunch. I'm not really into snow crab but other tables had plates full of them (you know they're getting their money's worth!). \\n\\nDesserts had an okay selection and the standout favorites of mine were the mango panna cotta and the cheesecake. The tiramisu panna cotta was also good. They have a soft serve ice cream machine but I barely touched it since it melted right away in my bowl. I liked that they have a variety of soups and miso soup was a nice way to end my meal. \\n\\nIf you play MyVegas, you can save up enough loyalty points to redeem for a free weekday lunch buffet meal at Bellagio or even do a BOGO if you can't get enough. Quite an amazing deal. I certainly ate my money's worth which happened to be for the price of air.\",\n",

I had to stack up my plates real high so that they can see it, and would then bother to come over to take it away.

In my books, no steak = no buffet, especially premium priced buffets!! Stir fry vegetables, Panda Panda does better, in both taste, presentation, selection and quality!  Egg Benedict, this is my favorite, good hollandaise sauce and runny yolk, yum! But for this to be a highlight is pretty sad.\\n\\nDessert: Decent, but nothing exciting and poorly presented.

The blown stained glass sculptures on the ceiling are beautiful. \\n\\nIt is ~$46 for one adult dinner buffet ticket. There are at least 8 serving areas with tons and tons of food choices. I was starving when I walked in so I made the amateur mistake of piling up my plate before thoroughly checking all the choices. Here's what I liked the most out of everything I tried:\\n\\n1. Snow crab/king crab legs- this is a very popular item at this buffet. Delicious but of course very messy. Our waiter was very considerate and brought us plenty of wet toilettes. \\n2. Caviar- I only tried the American caviar atop the bellini, but this was goooood. Rich, salty, flavorful, and absolutely delicious. \\n3. Mango coconut panna cotta- this was a flavor explosion in a mini jar. Yummmmmy. Light and really fantastic!\\n4. Steak tartare- served over toast and very tasty. \\n\\nGreat experience! Enjoyed and spent 2 hours here.\",\n",

There is also no gelato! They only had the self serve ice cream machines so it wasn't special at all. Compared to the buffet in wynn and cosmopolitan this one is really not up to par.

Once getting past the hostess and were showed to our seats it is a wonder to me why there is even a line.  More than half of the room we were sitting in was empty and it seemed there were more than enough servers and bussers to handle this size room.  \\n\\nWell getting past all of these things and getting to the food.

It is a shame what they did to the kobe beef it wasn't tender or juicy but dry and bland.  The chef that cooked this meat should be fired as it is the worst peace of steak I have ever had.  It tasted so bad I wasn't even sure if it was Kobe beef or not.  Another shame is the crab legs, these things tasted like they had been soaked in salt water over night and were the saltiest crab legs I have ever tried.  \\n\\nGetting away from these two bad things the service was excellent and all of the other entrees that I have were just spectacular.

If they weren't available they maybe should let you know in advance. The snow crab was served ice cold. I much prefer them hot.

The crab legs were a lot less meaty than I remembered, and had so much ice in them it was hardly enjoyable. I will say that the desserts, for the most part, were really beautiful looking -- however, once you bite into one, you quickly realize that is was probably made the day before.

       "       'Maybe the biggest mistake that I made when I decided to go to The Buffet at Bellagio is to give it such a high expectation that it doesn\\'t deserve. At the end, it failed my expectation in every single way that left me the taste of unsavoriness after I left this restaurant.\\nThe Buffet begins with a ridiculously long waiting line, which until now, I don\\'t understand the hype behind it. Lucky for us, we didn\\'t have to wait long since \"the customers left quickly after they came\", according to the cashier. But sadly, my joke \"hopefully it\\'s not because of the food\" actually became true!!\\nBefore you can pick up a plate and get whatever you want to gorge, you were seated in a place that instantly reminds you that maybe a \"restaurant\" like Denny\\'s offers you better place, somehow it looks amazingly familiar to any Chinese buffet that you happen to visit in your life: Full of people, loud, messy, horrible decor.. Not exactly quite an enjoyable feeling to start your dishes.\\nNow, let\\'s talk about the main \"spotlight\": the food, the reason that immediately disappointed me after I finish my first plate. My impression with The buffet at Bellagio is that half of the Buffet is Chinese food (which I recommend you should go to PF. Chang for better quality) and the rest of the buffet is a combination of a hell lot of things that left you no remark in your mind no matter how hard you try to remember. Oh my mistake, the Kobe Beef is okay but the rest is...\"Cliché\". The lamb is not that special, it\\'s dry and has nothing to remember about the taste. The turkey, the Alaska crab and King Crab made you regret that you got too much on your plate of it and the amount of time you have to line up for that (take note: the line is bizarrely long). Even you asked the chef to heat up the seafood for you, it\\'s still cold and you curse your life that now you have to eat those. The seafood definitely doesn\\'t meet up your expectation. I would give the seafood 2* out of 5.\\nNext, you move quickly to the main reason what got you here tonight: The Caviar. You have to stay in a line, but fortunately, it\\'s not too long since maybe people are not aware of the fact that Bellagio also offers Caviar, maybe it\\'s too small to notice. The Chef will handle you 3 small pieces of some bread that have caviar on top of that. The truth is those bread are the murderers of the taste of the caviar which are supposed to deliver. Normally, they go with cracker or at least some crispy bread, but this one is soft and kinda sweet. They viciously deconstructed and ruined the whole flavor of the caviar which made you question yourself: Did you just have caviar since you don\\'t even feel a thing???? Next round, I decided to leave the bread out and had the caviar by itself, it\\'s better but I really don\\'t want to go all the way there and get 3 tiny bites of caviar again since they don\\'t give you more than that each round. I wish I wouldn\\'t pay $50 (included tip and tax) for this Gourmet meal, you have way better selection out there, folks, way better!!\\nAnd another sad news for sushi and sashimi lovers, Bellagio has a poor selection of sushi and really boring sashimi. Their sushi and sashimi made you think that any sushi restaurants that you\\'ve been to could gives a better offer than this one.\\nNot only the lame sushi section, their dessert is not remarkable either. I don\\'t remember much except the feeling, even the Wicked Spoon buffet, aka an extended version of Panda Express gives you more satisfactory than the dessert at the Bellagio. Gosh, the whole meal is like an endless torturing and regretful feeling that you want to get out as soon as possible after you tried to gorge to make up for $50 you paid for that.\\nAnd did I mention about the attitude of the chefs working there? Oh gosh, it\\'s not nice, in my personal experience. They made you feel like you still are in high school cafeteria begging the lunch lady to give you better food. \\nI tried to hard to find one reason to come back to The Buffet at Bellagio but couldn\\'t come up with any... Oh well, now at least I can say \"The gourmet buffet at the Bellagio??? Urghh, I pass!!\" with confidence.',\n",

Including Bellagio I went to three of them. Last night was the first time I went to the buffet at Bellagio. I learned from my previous buffet there's a strategy when you eat at buffets. You need to approach them as if you're eating at a tapas eatery - get three items on a plate. I ended up having 8 plates. Instead of naming every item I ate I will mention the highlights. The chorizo sausage and pork and chicken sausage were tasty. The smoked salmon, ceviche, and calamari salad were fresh and clean. The prime rib was cooked rare to my liking. The baby back ribs had a sweet glaze taste. The chocolate and vanilla éclairs were light and sweet. The rice pudding was also a nice filling for desert. There were three things I didn't like. Even though the pepperoni pizza came out of the oven the crust was chewy not crunchy. I found the snow crab legs to taste a little salty. I wish they served the bones of the prime rib. They're the tastiest part of the prime ribs. Overall The Buffet at Bellagio is a decent buffet. In terms of the Big 4 Buffets at the Strip (I haven't been to the Wynn yet) I would rank in order Bacchanal Buffet, Bellagio, and Wicked Spoon (at this buffet I went at the worst time on Saturday brunch and may go back at a better time).\",\n",

After paying, we continue to wait to be seated. We were seated immediately by the entrance. We declined the table and chose to wait for another. We did not want people watching us eat as they were waiting to be seated. We were seated at a booth and was immediately greeted by Gilbert, our host for that section. \\n\\nWhile some of the food was on the high end side (caviar), it wasn\\'t a wow factor. We went on a Friday night so they king crab legs. They were cooked and self-served on ice. After taking the split in half king crab legs, we were able to take them to where the snow crab legs were, where the cook warmed them in the water for us. By the time you walked with the crab legs all the way to your table, they got cold again.\\n\\nWhat was most UNAPPETIZING was watching all the cooks along the line wipe around the foods but the dish rag was dipping in and out of the foods. It was because of that, my choices were limited to eat. I couldn\\'t even wait for them to change the trays of food hoping for a new tray, as all they did was add more into it.',\n",

Alcohol is not included in the price of the buffet, just in case you\\'re wondering for all you lushes out there.\\n\\nAs usual, I take a preview walk of the options before I start piling my plate, and I started to realize...there aren\\'t that many options. \\n\\nMy first plate with mashed potatoes, a cut of the prime rib, some fried rice, dungeoness crab legs and some cocktail shrimp.\\n\\nSecond plate - Large copious amounts of snow crab legs, a pork of some kind that I can\\'t remember, and some sushi.\\n\\nAll of the food I can say, is pretty average to below average. The snow crab legs were overly cooked and salty, the sushi was dry and boring, and there weren\\'t as many options as I was expecting. I think the biggest problem, and all large buffets like this suffers from, is that theres too many options and some food tend to sit there and wait for the newest overeater to come by and pick them up.\\n\\nThis is especially the case of the dessert, which had at least 15 options not including the self-serve ice cream. All the desserts I sampled were just either too dry because they\\'ve been sitting out for too long, or are overly too sweet, which I guess is my personal preference.\\n\\nWould I go back again? Probably not, especially not at the cost of $40+ per person. But if you\\'re new to Vegas, I say, why not, give it a shot and form your opinion.

The problem....they were frozen solid. I took two legs and let them rest a few mins figuring they would thaw out and be ok...they were too far gone frozen. Honestly just crappy. I was very disappointed with the whole thing especially for the place and the price.\",\n",
       "       \"Not sure why The Buffet at Bellagio is so highly rated. We waited an hour to get into a mostly empty buffet Food was lackluster; particularly bad was the sushi (rice was cold and hard), BBQ chicken (BBQ sauce tasted like McDonalds packets), snow crab (snow crab is never that good but theirs was small with no flavor). Also the wine is crazy expensive, $17 for a glass of Chardonnay? They did mention the all-you-can-drink special, which is only a few dollars more than a single glass, but didn't actually say how much each glass is. One star for the desserts, which were tasty.\",\n",

It was a smorgasbord of food.  from beef wellington to mac and cheese (which is AMAZING!)... everything is delish!  especially the desserts.  our table was filled with deserts.  we had one of almost everything there and we were sampling it all.  i used to think paris was the best buffet but man i was so wrong from now on were going to the bellagio!\",\n",

Even during the slower periods of the day, there's always a line coming out of the entrance. The food here must be good right? I mean, it's a luxury hotel casino for crying out loud! Is it any good at all? \\n\\nYes. Yes it is.\\n\\nAlthough the wait may be a little lengthy for even the most patient of patrons, I must say that the Buffat at Bellagio did do it's fair service. First and foremost, there's plenty to choose from. Although it seems like seafood is the focus here, there are items such as freshly carved meats and sides for the taking, as well as a fairly decent array of Italian dishes. Going back to the seafood, however, it was definitely up to par for being a buffet. \\n\\nMost places, when they do seafood, it's usually budget-level offerings such as cod, and maybe salmon or catfish. Not here. The Snow crab legs were absolutely divine. There probably wasn't a plate in the entire restaurant that didn't have crab legs on it. The sushi tasted surprisingly clean and fresh, which again, I must say is a little odd for buffet-style cuisine!\\n\\nPrime rib? Perfect. It was a perfect medium-rare and didn't even need au jus to enhance the flavor. Very good stuff. \\n\\nMy only complaint, is that the service is a tad rough. I understand it's busy, but something more than 2 visits to my table for refills on beverages needs to be addressed. That's the only thing that's holding me back from giving the Buffet at Bellagio a full 5-star rating.\",\n",

For the seafood lovers shrimp and crab legs galore.  They have a a variety of foods from around the world but it was all okay.  My favorite parts of the meal were probably the mushroom ravioli and the creme brulee for dessert.  Other than that I wasn't too impressed with my recent visit to this buffet.\",\n",

My favorites being the king crab legs the beef wellington and beef bourguignon but they had so many choices and Kobe style beef sirloin prime rib turkey Italian and Japanese cuisine as well as Chinese American and seafood selections.

Beef wellington is not that hard to make at a five star level. I can't believe they can't figure out how to make it better. This is the Bellagio, isn't it? Prime rib and kobe steak also need help.\\n\\nAll that said, i still come because the king crab and a few other items make it worth it to me.

I checked back several times and the only additional rolls they added were a veggie roll. No salmon? No tuna? I also tried the flank steak which was pretty good, brisket, and ribs, They were all pretty good. Not amazing like i anticipated. I actually found the pizza to be the best part of the options i tried. I indulged in shrimp and a few desserts. the desserts were decent, but not what i had expected. I left feeling like they had been hiding all the amazing stuff that has been ranted and raved about.

The lack-luster buffet is in desperate need of a renovation. Seating, presentation and ambience is low. No longer proper waited service for drinks, self serve with automatic machines found in common fast food establishments. The drink ware is in plastic!!! Glass cups no longer in fashion? The food itself lacks flavor and tastes similar to pre-made frozen meals. It appears this buffet is cutting every corner possible. The meat was dry and no variety. The quality very low. Mash potatoes tasted from powder and not made fresh. Small crabs... Bananas were even black. I compare this buffet to low grade budget buffets, which is sad since one would have very high expectations from a high end hotel at this price level. I was hoping the deserts would at least make up for the meal, unfortunately not. Most buffets have gilato stations, or crepe stations, but not here. Self serve watered down ice cream machine, self serve! Another budget cut. I would compare the deserts to store made pre-packed baked goods.

The crab legs were already cracked in half for you, so you didn\\'t have to work to get your crab meat. It was instant gratification that I had never felt while eating crab. I really liked it. The huge downside were that the legs were cold, but you can\\'t always win.\\n\\nI calculated that around my 3rd plate of crabs, that I was near getting my money\\'s worth. So, I decided to venture off and try some of the other items. The prime rib was dry and the chicken wellington really didn\\'t impress me. I went back to the crab legs.\\n\\nThat being said, the experience was worth it. Vegas buffet\\'s really did meet my expectations and I\\'m anxious to try the others as well.',\n",

I thought the seafood and desserts were going to be good because of the price I paid. The snow crabs were all half frozen and I had to have them steamed before I could eat them. The desserts were okay but way worse than I expected. The Asian food was also disappointed: the Chinese broccoli was nearly tasteless and the miso soup tasted like soy sauce in water. The only thing I liked was the smoked salmon. The tuna poke was also good. But I don't think I will return any time soon.\",\n",
       "       'I\\'m being generous by giving out three stars.\\n\\nEnvironment:\\nThe buffet is located through the casino (of course) and right near the guest elevators. You have to wait in (a longggg) line and then they shuttle you off to a table. Like any other buffet, you sit down, order drinks, and move towards the plates. Yet, on this special day, as I sat down, I immediately felt sticky goo on my legs. Why would I feel this, you ask? Oh, only because there was SYRUP ALL OVER MY CHAIR! When I stood up, my dress was sticking to the chair and my legs were covered in goo. Disgusting. The waiter/bus boy simply handed me a wet towel (am I supposed to wipe down the chair myself?) and told me he would send over a manager. I peeled myself off the chair, of course the syrup all over my dress, and had to go back to my room and change. LUCKILY, I was staying at the Bellagio. What if I hadn\\'t been staying there? Would I have to take a taxi with syrup all over me? After changing and coming back to the buffet, thirty minutes had already passed, and I had tickets to a show in less than an hour. Therefore, my $40 dinner was clearly not going to be worth it for me; who spends less than an hour at a buffet?? Did they refund me my dinner? No. They just offered to dry clean my dress.\\n\\nFood:\\nThe food is OKAY. The prime rib was juicy and tender, but they were stingy with the end cuts, the horseradish was not very spicy, and their au jus was too salty. The turkey was dry and only good because of their cranberry sauce that I poured over the meat (their cranberry sauce is good but could use more cloves/orange peel). The pesto mashed potatoes were my favorite, but I realized I was just filling up on carbs and had to save room for bigger and better things. The crab legs had lemon already squeezed on them - don\\'t they realize not everyone likes lemon on their crab? The crab did not taste that fresh to me...a bit too fishy and not like the sea. Perhaps the lemon was to hide the non-freshness...? I tried their pesto chicken pasta and it was WAY too salty! I couldn\\'t have more than one bite. The sweet potato puree had too much orange juice/flavoring or whatever they add. The sushi was definitely NOT fresh and probably only deserves one or two stars (please compare to A\\'Float Sushi). The salmon sushi was dry (how can raw fish be dry? how long was it sitting there?) and tasted like old sushi. Same goes for the albacore sushi. The only good thing from their raw fish/\"Asian\" section was the salmon poke not because the salmon quality was good (although it was better than the sushi\\'s) but because the sauce was good. The dessert was the best part because they have a nice selection of sweet treats. The key lime was good, but the carrot cake was disappointing (too dry!).\\n\\nWhy three stars?\\nOverall, the food at the Bellagio buffet is decent: the prime rib deserves five stars but their sushi only deserves one star. The service was crappy, but I feel like that is the overall experience at the Bellagio (the guest service wasn\\'t that great at the Bellagio, but that\\'s another review).',\n",

As you walk into the buffet area you are greeted with a large assortment of sushi (both nigiri and various rolls).  I passed on these and headed to the pile of crab legs lurking behind the sushi bar.  They split the crab legs so that they are easier to eat, which is a plus.  No need to waste precious buffet time cracking open a bunch of crab legs!  Also along the way you will find traditional American cuisine such as mashed potatoes and prime rib, along with other ethnic delights such as grape leaves and Chinese specialties.  Among the surprises was the beef wellington, which is not found at most other buffets.  It melts in your mouth.

There was a large selection of grilled/baked/steamed/what have you fish filets, including tilapia, salmon, and cod.  I particularly liked their cod.  The sushi selection is limited, featuring only the usual suspects you'd see anywhere that serves sushi and nigiri.  No eel :(\\n\\nAs for the snow crab legs, they were cold (but aren't they cold everywhere?).  My only real complaint is that they were kind of too salty.  I didn't gorge on those like I normally do at buffets, but that's fine since I was saving room for dessert.\\n\\nThe dessert selection was impressive.  Not only was it vast but the pre-plated desserts were actually complex and innovative, not just variations on yellow cake.  The banana walnut cake was a sleeper hit -- it was amazing and actually distinguished itself from a banana walnut muffin that I'm so used to eating.  The tirimisu had a real alcoholic kick, which I liked.  The miniature ice cream cones filled with vanilla or dark chocolate cremes were delicious -- bonus points to the vanilla one because its cone is lined with nutella on the inside.  As for the un-plated desserts, like bread pudding and bananas foster, I did not try them.  They appeared to be forgotten and unappealing since that section of the dessert bar was not even lighted... o.O \\n\\nOverall I was satisfied with eating at The Big B.

Instead it was very old-fashioned, seemed like I was dining at one of the station casino's buffet. \\n\\nOther than the layout of the buffet, the quality of the food was not bad at all. There were lots of variety and the staff members kept the king crab/snow crab fresh. However the prime rib was horrible. The desserts were my favorite. (I have a crazy sweet tooth thats why.)

Everything else was a mixture of hit and miss, with some stuff being pretty darn good, especially if you could grab it fresh (the eggs benedict) and others being terrible (the pizza).  It's a wide mix of food styles, containing everything from Asian noodle salad and steamed pork buns to pickled herring and other Norwegian foods.  It's certainly a notch above the quality of the average buffet in Vegas, although you pay for privilege.  Our server was fairly with it, keeping us supplied with drink refills and whisking away the empty plates.

I realize you takes your chances with  a buffet menu, especially when you wait so long between visits. (And speaking of waiting so long, the line was surprisingly lengthy for our mid-afternoon arrival, but I suppose we were not the only cheapos who figured on paying the lunch price just before they switched over to dinner.

Crab leg were served cold, which is fine by me, especially when I saw the eye roll another diner got when he asked the line cook to have his heated. Not one interesting item at the bread station - guess they want you to fill up on the expensive stuff, so we did.\\n\\nThe prime rib was like butta, and the brisket was also pretty tasty. They were carving a large roast of what was labeled Wagyu beef. Now, I am of the understanding that this particular meat draws its signature tenderness from a pampered life of massage and  a high carb diet. I think the guy they carved up for this one had been sneaking off to the gym to work out at night. It didn\\'t save his life, but he put up a great battle against my knife. \\n\\nThey had a pretty decent variety of desserts, but not the macarons. At least. that\\'s we thought at first. Turned out they had some they were \"going to put out later\". In other words: when the place was full of full-price dinner patrons. But, they did spring loose with them, but they were raspberry and therefore a disappointment. Also, they broke out some pretty tasty chicken masala when we were too full to enjoy it.\\n\\nSo, it\\'s pretty much like most buffets in that you can find more than enough items that you like to put you in physical distress, but it\\'s not as good as it used to be.',\n",

I had four different types of ceviches and every single one of them was delicious. I also ate a marinara pasta they served at dinner and ate a plateful of it. Bellagio knows how to do pasta!\\n\\nMy only complaint is that the food organization seems a little wild. One of my favorite things about Cravings at the Mirage is that patrons can choose which section of the buffet they want to visit based on \"ethnic\" or \"type.\" At the mirage, if you\\'re in the mood for salad, you go to the salad section.... if you want Chinese, you go to the Chinese section.... if you want Italian, you go to the Italian section, and so on. The Bellagio has no signs or clear cut divisions, so I had to walk around the buffet several times to gather an idea of where everything I wanted was. This is only a minor gripe though!\\n\\nOther foods I distinctly remember because of how scrumptious they tasted are the roasted squash and the marinated mushrooms. The mushrooms were available at both lunch and dinner, while the squash was available during lunch. The squash was slightly sweet due to a brown sugar coating and it was perfectly caramelized. I would never have expected to eat such a great squash dish at a buffet. Usually vegetables at buffets are boring and low on taste, but not at the Bellagio! I\\'ll definitely visit the Bellagio for meals again.',\n",
       "       'Bellagio is back! A long time ago before Wynn Resort even existed Bellagio was the king! Then it slipped, but now they seem to get their game back on...at least with their buffet for starters. The wait still is a bitch, but once seated, ta-da! I had no complaint whatsoever...well, except for the old loser purposely piled up new crab legs after I picked through the old ones was a pathetic display of discrimination toward Asians. LOL! The price was fair($30 weeknights), prime rib & lamb shank all done right, our favorite shrimp cocktails were bigger & more succulent than all competitors, desserts all tasted just delishiyoso! I can go on, but don\\'t want to bore anyone. Just very glad Bellagio gained our taste buds\\' confidence back after the disappointment at Aria\\'s poor impression on not only \"so-called\" interior design, but also very bad service.  Long live Bellagio XD',\n",
       "       \"Came in at 1:30pm for lunch ($20) and left at 5:00pm. We made sure to pay the lunch price, but get the best of both worlds, lunch and dinner. They probably only had a handful of different dishes when the time changed. The crab came out during dinner so did other desserts, nigiri, and some other stuff I forgot. What I like about some of the buffets around here is that we can eat some food, leave the buffet to go outside, smoke, and gamble a bit, and came back and eat some more. We made sure we got our money's worth. I visited this buffet as well as the Paris buffet. Bellagio was way better. Like what others have said, if you like meat, you'll love this place. Tons of animals to eat from pork ribs, to chicken, to turkey, beef, prime rib, seabass, three different kinds of salmon, seafood up the yin yang,  and many others. My first plate was full of meat. They also had a little ice cream dispenser with caramel, fudge, and almonds...great, wish they had more toppings. Good desserts, flan, creme bulee, fruit tart, mousses. I can never find a buffet with good sushi, their sushi sucked. They have tons of food from Asian, to Italian, to whatever else you want. I felt like a freakin kid in a candy store.\",\n",

The service here is still attentive, refilling our drinks and taking away dirty dishes. Sadly, inconsistency has brought down the Buffet quality over the years. For example, the prime rib would sometimes be excellent; sometimes it's gosh darn terrible! The organization layout of the buffet is also a little bit confusing too. \\n\\nDo the cons outweigh the pros? Definitely not.

I enjoyed the quality and taste of food, but half the group considered it slightly above average. Bellagio is not cheap but a few bucks less than the buffets at Caesar's and Wynn. Crab legs were good, caviar ok, prime rib and rack of lamb good, sushi bad, street tacos good, service ok, deserts good to above average.   It's consistent in quality and range of choices, albeit not near Caesar's. $44 a person equated to 2 hours of dining. Definitely a good choice for Vegas buffet. Foodie out.\",\n",

Well, not this time. \\n\\nFirst, it's definitely not cheap, with the price (about $50) that I am paying, i am expecting some decent food. The crab leg section was a mess!! People picking and choosing and crab legs fell off everywhere. \\n\\nThe craving section was ok, the hot food section is boring and nothing exciting about it. Everything is just luke warm. \\n\\nThe sushi section doesn't look that fresh. And no sashimi. Only poke... Dessert, disappointing. Very generic, nothing special. \\n\\nWith this price, you can definitely pick a fancier restaurant and have a really nice meal. We were at MESA grill with Bobby Fay the last night, and they have special 3 course dinner for $50!! And the food there is delicious. So, don't settle for mediocre food for $50!!!\",\n",

The sushi fell apart easily, handrolls were made incorrectly without rice to close them, and nigiri was made via a pastry machine to form rice into its shape. The only meat that was okay was the roasted chicken. The kobe beef seems like feedlot meat and was well done. The seafood was a joke. They forgot to completely defrost the crab legs so they had crunchy slush inside the meat. Mussels were tiny. \\nDesserts were a disappointment once you tasted them. \\n\\nOh yeah, I ended with food poisoning that night. It was not fun.',\n",

I had called and asked if they were serving Alaskan King crab and was told yes; nope, all they were serving was salty snow crab.  Also, all of the other items were completely subpar, including the tasteless prime rib.  This used to be one if the top buffets, but sadly no longer.\",\n",

At $60 per person, it doesn't even equate to a good value compared to eating at some of the finer dining establishments. But, the buffet here is still one of the better ones around in terms of quality and freshness.  As more and more buffets go over the top, Bellagio's seems to be a bit outdated.\\n\\njust be wary of the fact that the prices can jump depending on the day and season.  Normally it should have been $30, but it was double that for dinner when we went.

A wonderful sushi bar. An entire area devoted to wonderful european style thin crust pizzas - seven or eight kinds, and other Italian delicacies. There was a station of delicious innovative salads and an area of warm meats - loin of pork done on a rotisserie in the background, prime rib slices, chicken wellington and on and on.\\n\\nThe selections were terrific either for vegetarian or meat eaters. A relaxed environment with no rushing and adequate table service for drinks by very friendly waitstaff.

Some pieces were soft and fresh while others were blah.\\n \\nAll the desserts were sooooo good!  Probably the best part of my meal. So many wonderful choices!!!

Not everyone eats at the same time, not everyone waits in a long line, not everyone pays the same price, not everyone eats the same thing, and not everyone has the same tastes in food.\\n\\nAnd not everyone tasted ostrich before. Strangely, the way it was prepared and cooked, it tasted just like chashu BBQ pork. So it was pretty tasty, but I couldn't help but have a mental image of an ostrich with his head buried in the ground. \\n\\nI'm not the biggest fan of prime rib, but I loved it here. It was tender, juicy, and super flavorful. Put some baby mushrooms with the au jus sauce on top, it had me coming back for more. Even when my stomach was about to explode.\\n\\nThe crab legs? I'm always apprehensive because they are the epitome of inconsistency in buffets. They could either still be semi-frozen and not entirely thawed out, they could be too salty, they could have some funky fishy flavor, or they could be skimpy on size and meat. Here, during my recent visit, everything was spot on.\\n\\nOther favorites include the chilean seabass, salmon, and the braised beef. Nothing I tried was overcooked or bland. When it came time for dessert, I didn't hold back. My favorites would be the creme brulee, flan, mousse with apricot, and the chocolate covered strawberries. \\n\\nSurprisingly, the line around 5:30pm on a Saturday night was not very long. It was only after we left around 7pm that it snaked around the casino floor. I thought for the quality and quantity of food we ate, $35 per person was a bargain. By far, better than the Wynn buffet on my last visit, or any other buffet on the Strip for that matter. IMHO.\\n\\nOf course, let's hope things are this good in my next visit.

I've seen documentaries and food shows featuring this Buffett and had high expectations. There was very little to choose from, especially compared to the other buffets I visited last time.

I was here for a holiday dinner last December and the buffet had a salad and sushi station with made to order salads and fresh sushi. Carving stations include turkey, beef wellington, prime rib, kobe beef and lamb. All of the meats were well seasoned, juicy, tender and melt in your mouth good. The pizza was AMAZING - I've tried my fair share of buffet pizza and their's definitely does not scrimp on quality or taste. There is also a variety of Asian and Italian dishes, soups, and sides galore. And then there's dessert - oh dessert - so YUM.

So we all get what we ant and it didn't seam so bad for all the food you can get. They had crab legs and prime rib. I joked and told my wife where else can you get crab legs and tacos on one plate.  I like this place. Also my kid liked the deserts and ice cream. So all in all it was a win for the family. The food was good quality not your typical bland Buffett food.\",\n",

I seriously would not feed this food to my dog. Everything is presented well and looks good sitting out but don\\'t be fooled, no flavor, canned mushrooms, bad asparagus, pitiful salad bar, the \"crab legs\" were more like little pieces of crab with no meat. The only side toppings to put on your salad was cucumber, very odd. The pre-made Kale grapefruit salad was gross. \\nThe only compliment I can give was the shrimp were pretty good.\\nDo any of the Chefs or managers actually taste this food before setting it out or are you just more focused on making it look appealing????????\\nDISGUSTING AND VERY VERY EXPENSIVE!',\n",

There doesn't seem to be much of a difference in food for the holiday's other than they charge you more for the same quality and selection of food. The prime rib and the leg of lamb were over done. The egg station was good, the cook was complaining about going home. (just go home!) but AYCE always makes me happy. so can't say i'd never come back, which is somewhat unfortunate.\",\n",

No food item really stood out unfortunately. I kept looking out for crab legs after reading several other Yelp reviews raving about them, but alas there were no crab legs to be found.
